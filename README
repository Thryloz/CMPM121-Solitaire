Patterns used: 
Classes for obvious reasons and therefore constructors
The cards have states

Postmortem:
I would add a "in pile" state to the cards.
Maybe write my own grabber class because having to pass in the piles and card tables feels wrong.
Also didn't manage to fix the weird issue of the card sometimes being drawn on top of another even though it's order is correct.


Sprites were drawn by me using Krita, all assets were made by me.
